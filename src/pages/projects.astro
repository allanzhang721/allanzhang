    title="AI for Fire Safety Classification"
    img="/fire.png"
    desc="Developed an AI-enabled user interface for time series classification to identify burning materials during fire incidents in real time.
          Designed robust distance-based and dictionary-based algorithms to classify burning materials with interpretable decision logic.
          Implemented domain-agnostic contrastive learning and adversarial latent space modeling with CNNs to enhance generalization under distributional shifts."
