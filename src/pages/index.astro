          I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering at the University of Toronto. 
          My research focuses on robust time series analysis and classification under distributional shift, with a particular emphasis 
          on online learning and test-time training. I am especially interested in real-world applications such as financial time series 
          forecasting and anomaly detection.
          <br /><br />
          Outside of research, I love playing badminton 🏸 — it's my favorite way to relax and stay active.

    desc="We address the limitations of standard test-time adaptation methods, such as Tent, in scenarios where we do not have labels during testing. Our approach mitigates compounding errors and early misprediction reinforcement in pseudo-labeling by stabilizing the adaptation process under weak initial representations and distributional shifts."
